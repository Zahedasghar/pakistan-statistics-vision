## What Do We Mean by Data Infrastructure?

When one uses the word "infrastructure", one thinks of roads, bridges, electricity grids or water supply systems. Physical things. But in the 21st century, data has become an even more important as a foundational layer for how societies function. And just like physical infrastructure, data infrastructure is not a single thing. It is a system of many parts working together. The Open Data Institute (ODI), which has done significant work on this concept, defines data infrastructure as consisting of "data assets, standards, technologies, policies and the organisations that operate and maintain them" (ODI, 2018). This is a useful starting point. 

But for a country like Pakistan, where the statistical system is still largely survey-dependent, we need to think about it in more practical terms. At its core, data infrastructure is the whole arrangement that makes it possible to collect data, store it safely, process it, share it across organisations, analyse it, and turn it into information that people can actually use. If any part of this arrangement is missing or weak, the output suffers. One can have the best data in the world, but if there is no legal framework allowing its sharing, it stays locked in a silo. One can have excellent technology, but without skilled people to operate it, it remain underutilised. 

The World Bank's Development Report 2021, titled "Data for Better Lives", made this point quite clearly. It argued that the value of data depends not just on its collection but on an entire ecosystem of governance, capacity, and trust that surrounds it (World Bank, 2021). Pakistan needs to take this seriously.

## Data Assets: The Raw Material

System of National Accounts 2025 (SNA 2025), endorsed by the UN Statistical Commission in March 2025, formally declares data as a produced asset. Data assets are the starting point of any infrastructure. These are the actual datasets, records, and files that contain information about people, businesses, transactions, geography, and so on. In Pakistan, the most obvious data assets are the ones produced by PBS — household surveys, labour force surveys, the population census, economic census. These are designed specifically for statistical purpose and they follow established methodology. But they are not the only data that exist. 

There is a large amount of administrative data sitting with ministries, federal agencies and other government departments. NADRA holds biometric and identity records for most of the population. FBR has tax records. BISP maintains records of social protection beneficiaries. SECP has data on registered companies and corporate filings. Regulatory bodies in telecom, banking, and energy also generate data as part of their normal operations. Provincial governments are another major source. Education departments collect enrollment and attendance data. Health departments track disease surveillance and facility usage. Agriculture departments collect crop data. Much of this is not shared with PBS or with other provinces. 
Then there is private sector data. Telecom companies have detailed call records and mobility data. Banks process millions of transactions daily. E-commerce platforms, food pandas, bykea, indrive and digital payment systems all generate data that could, in principle, provide real-time indicators of economic activity. Finally, there is data from Higher Education and academic institutions, NGOs, and international organisations. These often conduct their own surveys or compile datasets that supplement official statistics.  

The critical point is this: no single data source gives a complete picture. Each has gaps. Survey data is slow and expensive but is the best for statistical purposes. Administrative data was not designed for statistics. Private sector data may not be representative. As the UNECE guidelines on using administrative data for statistics point out, "the statistical use of administrative data requires careful assessment of coverage, concepts, and quality" (UNECE, 2011). The value comes from combining them thoughtfully.

## Technology: More Than Just Computers

When we talk about technology in the context of data infrastructure, we mean the tools and systems that allow data to be discovered, accessed, stored, processed, protected, and shared. This is a broad category. It includes the obvious things — servers, databases, cloud computing platforms, data warehouses. But it also includes less visible components that are equally important. Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), for example, are what allow different software systems to talk to each other and exchange data automatically. Without APIs, data sharing between agencies requires manual processes which are slow, error-prone, and difficult to scale. 

Data management platforms are needed for cataloguing what data exists, tracking its lineage (where it came from, how it was transformed), and maintaining metadata. Investment of time and resources for metadata is need of the hour as without it, linking data sets is not possible. Security systems — encryption, access controls, audit trails — are essential for protecting sensitive information. 

One concept that is especially relevant here is interoperability. This means the ability of different systems to work together. If PBS uses one format for geographic codes and NADRA uses a different one, linking their data becomes a technical headache. Common standards, shared identifiers, and compatible formats are what make interoperability possible. 

The European Interoperability Framework, developed by the European Commission, identifies four layers of interoperability: legal, organisational, semantic, and technical (European Commission, 2017). Pakistan's data infrastructure needs to address all four. It is not enough to just buy new hardware or install new software. The technology must be designed so that data can flow between organisations smoothly and securely. A study by Kitchin (2014) on "The Data Revolution" emphasised that the real challenge is not generating data — we already generate enormous volumes — but organising, managing, and governing it in ways that make it usable. This resonates strongly with Pakistan's situation.

## People and Expertise: The Human Factor

You can build the most advanced technology platform in the world. But if the people who supposed to use it lack the necessary skills, it will not deliver results. This is a lesson that many countries have learned the hard way. A functioning data infrastructure requires people with diverse skills. Some of these are technical — data engineering, statistical programming, machine learning, database administration. But others are equally important and often overlooked. These include data governance sepcialists, legal experts who understand privacy law and statisticians who can design multi-source surveys. People who can write metadata documentation. Communication and data-literacy experts who can explain statistical findings to non-technical audiences. 

Pakistan faces a significant skills gap in this area. PBS and provincial bureaus have experienced survey statisticians, but fewer staff with skills in data science, record linkage, or privacy-enhancing technologies. The training infrastructure for these skills is limited. Academia in Pakistan has also not played an active role and are not offering relevant programmes. The UN Statistical Commission has repeatedly emphasised that "modernisation of statistical production requires not only new technologies but new competencies" (UNSC, 2019). Countries that have successfully modernised their statistical systems — like Estonia, New Zealand, and the Netherlands — invested heavily in retraining their statistical workforce alongside technology upgrades. 

Building human capacity takes time. It cannot be done overnight. But it can be started immediately through targeted training programmes, partnerships with universities, staff exchanges with other national statistical offices, and recruitment of specialists from the private sector. Without this investment, technology alone will not solve the problem.

## Governance, Standards, and Legal Framework

This is perhaps the least visible but most critical component of data infrastructure. Governance refers to the rules, policies, processes, and institutional arrangements that determine how data is managed throughout its lifecycle. The DAMA International Data Management Body of Knowledge (DAMA-DMBOK) defines data governance as "the exercise of authority, control, and shared decision-making over the management of data assets" (DAMA International, 2017). In practical term, this means answering questions like: Who is responsible for a given dataset? Who can access it? For what purposes? Under what conditions? How is quality ensured? How are disputes resolved? 

For Pakistan, governance challenges are significant. There is no comprehensive legal framework that specifically addresses data sharing for statistical purposes across agencies. The Statistics Act provides PBS with certain authorities, but it does not fully cover the landscape of multi-source data that a modern infrastructure requires. 

Standards are a closely related issue. Data standards define how data should be structured, labelled, classified, and documented so that it can be understood and used across organisations. Without common standards, you get a situation where one agency records income in monthly terms, another in annual terms, a third in different currency or using different categories. Linking such data becomes extremely difficult. International standards like the Statistical Data and Metadata Exchange (SDMX) framework, maintained by international organisations including the UN, World Bank, and IMF, provide a starting point (SDMX.org, 2023). But these need to be adapted and adopted at country level. Pakistan has made limited progress in this area so far. 

The legal framework also needs attention. Laws governing privacy, data protection, and access to government records need to be reviewed and updated. Many countries have enacted specific legislation to enable the use of administrative data for statistics — for example, Australia's Data Availability and Transparency Act 2022. Pakistan needs similar legislative effort to provide legal clarity and protections for all parties. As Floridi and Taddeo (2016) argued in their influential work on data ethics, "the governance of data is not just a technical matter but a deeply social and political one." This applies fully to Pakistan's situation.

## Organisations and Institutional Arrangements

Data infrastructure does not operate in a vacuum. It is managed, maintained, and governed by organisations. These include statistical agencies (PBS and provincial bureaus), data-holding agencies (NADRA, FBR, BISP, etc.), oversight bodies, and coordination mechanisms. There is no formal institutional mechanism for coordinating data access and sharing between PBS and other federal or provincial agencies. Each agency has its own mandate, its own systems, and its own concerns about sharing data. This is not unique to Pakistan. Many countries faced similar fragmentation before undertaking reforms. The United Kingdom, for example, established the UK Statistics Authority as an independent body to oversee the statistical system and promote data sharing across government (UK Statistics Authority, 2007). Canada has the Canadian Centre for Data Development and Economic Research (CDER) which works to facilitate access to data from multiple sources for research. 

Whatever organisational model Pakistan chooses, certain features are essential. There must be a clear mandate and legal authority. There must be accountability to the public. And there must be mechanisms for coordination that bring different data holders together rather than leaving each agency to operate on its own. The institutional design must also recognise that data infrastructure is not only about government. Private sector, academia, civil society all have roles to play. A modern data infrastructure is a multi-stakeholder system. Its governance must reflect this reality. 


## Communities and Data Subjects

This component is often left out of technical discussions about data infrastructure, but it is among the most important. At the end of the day, much of the data we are talking about comes from people — citizens, households, businesses, communities. These are the data subjects. Their trust is essential. If people do not believe that their data will be handled responsibly, they will resist providing it. Survey response rates will continue to decline. Public opposition to data linking will grow. And the whole system will lose credibility. 

The OECD's Recommendation on Good Statistical Practice states that "public trust is a cornerstone of official statistics" and that statistical systems must operate with "transparency, accountability, and respect for individual privacy" (OECD, 2015). This is not abstract. It has direct implications for how data infrastructure is designed and communicated to the public. 

In Pakistan, building this trust requires active effort and for this data literacy programs have to be launched. People need to understand what data is being collected about them, how it is being used, and what safeguards are in place. There should be clear, accessible communication — not just legal notices buried in government websites, but genuine public engagement. 

Communities that are particularly vulnerable — low-income groups, minorities, women — may have additional concerns about how their data is used. The infrastructure must be designed with these concerns in mind. As Couldry and Mejias (2019) argued in "The Costs of Connection", data systems can reinforce existing inequalities if they are not designed with equity and inclusion as explicit goals.

## Tying It All Together

Data infrastructure is not any single component described above. It is the way all of these components work together. Data assets involves technology to be processed. Technology demands skilled people to operate it and people need governance frameworks to guide their work. Governance depends on enforcement of legal authority. And all of it needs the trust and participation of the communities whose data makes the system possible.
Think of it like a road system. The road itself (data assets) is necessary, but so are traffic rules (governance), traffic police (organisations), drivers who know how to drive (people), road signs and markings (standards), and the communities that use the road and benefit from the commerce it enables. Remove any of these elements and the system breaks down.
Pakistan's challenge is to build this system in a coherent way. Not piece by piece in isolated projects, but as an integrated national infrastructure that serves the country's information needs for decades to come.

## Think of It This Way
Data infrastructure is to statistical information what road infrastructure is to commerce. It is the underlying system of assets, tools, rules, people, and institutions that makes the production and use of statistics possible. And like physical infrastructure, it gains value only through use.
