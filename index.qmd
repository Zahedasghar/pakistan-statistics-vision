## About This Document

Pakistan has an enormous amount of data. NADRA holds biometric records for over 200 million citizens. The Federal Board of Revenue maintains tax files. BISP manages registries of millions of beneficiary households. Provincial health departments operate facility-level reporting systems. Education departments track enrolments and teacher deployments. The Pakistan Bureau of Statistics conducts censuses, labour force surveys, and household economic surveys. SBP has all financial transactions data. Other administrative and private sector data sets are in addition to that. Most of this data are institutional silos — collected by different agencies, for different purposes, using different definitions, in incompatible formats, with no systematic mechanism for combining it. The result is that a country of 241 million people makes policy decisions on the basis of information that is often incomplete, outdated, or fragmented. The data exists. What is missing is the infrastructure to make it usable.  
This document argues that Pakistan Bureau of Statistics needs a fundamental shift in how it produces and uses statistical information. Not by abandoning surveys, census and other data collections mechanisms , which remain essential, but by building a national data infrastructure. An infrastructure built on blending survey data with administrative records and other sources to produce statistics that are more timely, more granular, and more useful than any single source can provide alone. This requires repositioning the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics from a data collector to a national coordinator, establishing governance and legal frameworks for data sharing, investing in human capacity, protecting the rights of data subjects, and designing the system for the analytical demands of an AI-driven future. The chapters that follow develop this argument through diagnosis, international evidence, institutional analysis, and a sequenced set of priorities for implementation.

The Problem
:::

::: {.chapter-grid}

::: {.chapter-card}
### [1. Why Statistics Matter and Where Pakistan Stands Today](01-why-statistics-matter.qmd)
Statistics as national infrastructure, the pressures facing Pakistan's survey-based system, and why the current model — siloed agencies, periodic censuses, standalone surveys — can no longer meet the country's needs.

The Framework

### [2. Understanding Data Infrastructure](02-understanding-data-infrastructure.qmd)
What data infrastructure actually means — not just technology, but the combination of data assets, institutional arrangements, skills, governance frameworks, and the communities that sustain them.
:::

::: {.chapter-card}
### [3. The Case for Blended Data](03-case-for-blended-data.qmd)
Why no single data source is sufficient and what it takes to combine survey, administrative, geospatial, and other data sources to produce richer and more timely statistics.
:::

::: {.chapter-card}
### [4. Key Data Holders in Pakistan](04-key-data-holders.qmd)
Who holds the data that matters — from PBS, NADRA, FBR and SECP to provincial governments, BISP, private sector enterprises, and why coordination across these holders is the central challenge.

Principles & Governance

### [5. Core Principles for a Modern Data Infrastructure](05-core-principles.qmd)
The foundational principles — using data for the common good, proportionality, transparency, privacy by design, and institutional independence — that should guide Pakistan's infrastructure.
:::

::: {.chapter-card}
### [6. Repositioning PBS: From Data Collector to National Coordinator](06-repositioning-pbs.qmd)
The case for transforming PBS from an agency that collects its own data into one that coordinates, curates, and governs data flows across the entire national statistical system.
:::

::: {.chapter-card}
### [7. Data Quality: Fitness for Use](07-data-quality.qmd)
Why quality means more than accuracy — fitness for use, the dimensions of quality for blended data, metadata requirements, and the FAIR principles as a framework for making data usable.

### [8. Organisational Options for the New Infrastructure](08-organisational-options.qmd)
International models — from the Netherlands' centralised CBS to Estonia's distributed X-Road to Australia's AIHW — and what Pakistan can learn for designing its own institutional arrangement.
:::

::: {.chapter-card}
### [9. Ethics, Privacy, and the Rights of Data Subjects](09-ethics-privacy.qmd)
The care.data cautionary tale, re-identification risks, social licence, group privacy, the Five Safes framework, and why Pakistan's absent data protection law is a credibility crisis for the entire infrastructure.

### [10. Preparing for the Future: AI-Ready Data](10-ai-ready-data.qmd)
What AI-ready means in practice, the FAIR principles for machine consumption, the UK National Data Library concept, and why the data infrastructure is the binding constraint — not the algorithm.

### [11. Moving Forward: Priorities and Conclusion](11-moving-forward.qmd)
A sequenced plan — from data inventory and pilot projects to legal reform and institutional design — and why Pakistan's 241 million people deserve a statistical system equal to the complexity of their lives.
