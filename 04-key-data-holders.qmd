title: "Key Data Holders in Pakistan"
---

Building a new data infrastructure means first understanding who holds the data that can contribute to better national statistics. This might seem like a straightforward question. But in practice, Pakistan's data landscape is fragmented across dozens of organisations, each with its own mandate, its own systems, and its own reasons for collecting data. Some of these organisations produce data specifically for statistical purposes. Most do not. Yet all of them hold information that, if brought together thoughtfully, could transform the country's ability to understand itself.

The literature on national statistical modernisation consistently emphasises this point. As the UN Economic Commission for Europe noted in its guidelines on using secondary data sources, "the potential supply of data for official statistics extends far beyond what statistical offices themselves collect" (UNECE, 2011). The challenge is mapping this landscape, understanding what each holder brings to the table, and creating the conditions under which their data can be accessed and used.


## Statistical Agencies

The Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) and the provincial Bureaus of Statistics are the primary producers of official statistics in the country. They conduct the population census, labour force surveys, household income and expenditure surveys, agricultural surveys, and a range of other data collection exercises. Their mandate is explicitly statistical — they collect data to produce estimates that inform public policy and planning.

This matters because it means their data follows established quality controls. Sampling frames are designed, questionnaires are tested, field work is supervised, and results go through validation and estimation procedures. The UN Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics, adopted by the General Assembly in 2014, lay out the standards that national statistical offices are expected to follow, including professional independence, scientific methods, and confidentiality of individual data (United Nations, 2014). PBS operates under these principles, at least in aspiration.

But PBS and provincial bureaus face well-known constraints. Their budgets are limited. The population census, which is the most comprehensive data collection exercise, happens only once a decade — and even then, it has faced significant delays in Pakistan's history. Between censuses, surveys provide useful but incomplete pictures. Labour force surveys, for instance, have sample sizes that do not allow for reliable estimates at the district level for many indicators. Household surveys typically take 12 to 18 months from fieldwork to publication, which limits their timeliness.

The declining quality of survey data is not unique to Pakistan. Groves (2011) documented how survey research globally has entered what he called a "third era" characterised by falling response rates, rising costs, and growing reliance on supplementary data sources. Pakistan's statistical agencies face all of these pressures, compounded by security challenges in certain regions, limited field staff, and weak infrastructure in remote areas.

Provincial Bureaus of Statistics deserve separate mention. Since the 18th Constitutional Amendment devolved significant responsibilities to provinces, provincial statistical capacity has become more important. But most provincial bureaus remain understaffed and under-resourced. Their relationship with PBS is also complicated — there is no uniform framework for how federal and provincial statistical agencies coordinate data collection, share data, or harmonise standards.

Despite all these limitations, statistical agencies remain the backbone of the system. They have the mandate, the institutional knowledge, and the methodological expertise. What they lack is access to the wider data ecosystem that could supplement their surveys and make their estimates more timely, more granular, and more comprehensive.


## Federal Administrative Agencies

Some of the richest data in Pakistan sits with federal agencies that collect it not for statistical purposes but as part of their normal administrative functions. This data is generated as a byproduct of government operations — registering citizens, collecting taxes, delivering social protection, regulating businesses.

**NADRA (National Database and Registration Authority)** is perhaps the most significant data holder in this category. It maintains the national identity database, which covers a very large proportion of Pakistan's adult population through the Computerised National Identity Card (CNIC) system. NADRA's data includes biometric information, addresses, family linkages, and demographic details. This database has been used for various purposes beyond its original registration mandate — including verification for BISP social protection, electoral rolls, and SIM card registration.

The potential of national identity systems for statistical purposes has been explored in other countries. Abraham et al. (2018) discussed India's Aadhaar system and its implications for governance, noting that universal identity databases can serve as a backbone for linking administrative records across agencies. Pakistan's CNIC system has similar potential, though it also raises significant privacy concerns that must be addressed.

**FBR (Federal Board of Revenue)** holds tax records for individuals and businesses. This includes income tax returns, sales tax data, customs records, and information from the withholding tax system. Tax data can provide detailed information about economic activity, income distribution, and the size of the formal economy. However, Pakistan's tax base is notoriously narrow — the number of registered taxpayers does not come close to covering the full working population — which limits coverage. Tax data also has well-known issues with underreporting and evasion, which statistical agencies would need to account for in any analysis.

**BISP (Benazir Income Support Programme)** maintains detailed records on social protection beneficiaries. Its National Socioeconomic Registry (NSER), which was compiled through a door-to-door poverty census, covers a very large number of households and contains information about demographics, assets, housing conditions, and vulnerability indicators. The NSER is one of the most comprehensive household-level databases in Pakistan and could be extremely valuable for producing poverty statistics and for calibrating survey estimates.

**SECP (Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan)** holds data on registered companies, corporate filings, financial statements, and securities markets. This data is useful for understanding the corporate sector, investment patterns, and economic concentration.

Other federal agencies that hold significant data include the State Bank of Pakistan (financial system data), Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (telecom subscriber data), NEPRA (electricity consumption data), OGRA (oil and gas data), and various line ministries that maintain management information systems (MIS) for their programmes.

The common challenge across all these agencies is that their data was collected for specific operational purposes. The definitions, classifications, coverage, and quality controls were designed to serve those purposes — not statistical analysis. As Wallgren and Wallgren (2007), in their comprehensive guide on register-based statistics, noted, "administrative data reflect administrative reality, not statistical reality." Converting administrative data into statistical outputs requires careful assessment and adjustment. Coverage may not be universal. Definitions may not match survey concepts. Data quality may vary across regions or over time.

Despite these challenges, the volume and richness of administrative data in Pakistan is considerable. The key barrier is not the data itself but the lack of frameworks, legal provisions, and institutional mechanisms for accessing it for statistical purposes.


## Provincial Governments

Pakistan's provinces hold enormous amounts of data across their various departments and agencies. Since the 18th Amendment, provinces have primary responsibility for health, education, agriculture, local governance, and many social services. This means that much of the data about how these services are delivered — and what outcomes they produce — sits at the provincial level.

**Education departments** in all four provinces and the federal areas maintain Education Management Information Systems (EMIS) that track school enrollment, attendance, teacher deployment, and infrastructure. Punjab and Sindh have invested more heavily in digitising these systems, while Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa face greater challenges. The data can provide granular, real-time information about educational access that household surveys can only capture periodically.

**Health departments** collect data through the District Health Information System (DHIS), which tracks facility-based health indicators including disease surveillance, immunisation coverage, maternal health services, and facility utilisation. Pakistan adopted the DHIS2 platform, which is used in many developing countries, and this data is potentially very useful for producing health statistics between surveys. However, private health facilities, which account for a large share of healthcare delivery in Pakistan, are generally not covered.

**Agriculture departments** maintain crop reporting systems, livestock census data, and agricultural inputs data. Given that agriculture remains a large part of Pakistan's economy and employs a significant share of the workforce, this data is directly relevant for national accounts and food security analysis.

**Revenue departments** hold land records, property transaction data, and related information that is relevant for wealth estimation and economic analysis. Many provinces have been digitising their land records through projects like Punjab's Land Records Management Information System.

**Social welfare departments**, labour departments, local government bodies, and planning departments all generate data as part of their work. The problem is that this data is often not standardised, not easily accessible, and not shared with statistical agencies at either the provincial or federal level.

The fragmentation between provinces is also a significant issue. Each province may use different classifications, different software systems, and different data formats. There is no common framework for harmonising provincial data, which makes it very difficult to produce consistent national-level statistics from provincial sources.

This is not just a Pakistan problem. Groen (2012) documented similar challenges in the United States, where state-level administrative records needed significant harmonisation work before they could be used for federal statistical purposes. But it is a problem that Pakistan must solve if provincial data is to be leveraged effectively.


## Private Sector

The private sector in Pakistan generates a massive volume of data that could, if made accessible under appropriate conditions, significantly improve the timeliness and granularity of national statistics. This is an area where international practice is evolving rapidly.

**Telecommunications companies** — Jazz, Telenor, Zong, Ufone — collectively serve the overwhelming majority of Pakistan's mobile subscribers. Their data includes call detail records, mobile money transactions (especially through platforms like JazzCash and Easypaisa), and location data derived from cell tower connections. This data can provide near-real-time indicators of population mobility, economic activity, and even disaster displacement. Blumenstock, Cadamuro, and On (2015) demonstrated in Rwanda that mobile phone metadata could be used to predict poverty levels at high spatial resolution, illustrating the statistical potential of telecom data.

**Banks and financial institutions** process millions of transactions daily. Transaction data can provide timely indicators of consumer spending, economic confidence, and financial inclusion. The State Bank of Pakistan already publishes aggregate financial statistics, but more granular data from individual banks — properly anonymised — could enhance economic measurement.

**E-commerce and digital platforms** — such as Daraz, Careem, Foodpanda, and various digital payment systems — generate data on consumer behaviour, service demand, pricing, and employment in the gig economy. These platforms are growing rapidly in Pakistan and their data could help capture economic activities that traditional surveys miss.

**Large retailers, manufacturers, and agricultural commodity markets** also hold data that could provide high-frequency economic indicators. International experience supports this. Statistics Canada, for instance, has developed programmes like the Canadian Survey on Business Conditions to collect high-frequency data from businesses across provinces, improving the timeliness of economic statistics considerably (Statistics Canada, 2020). The Dutch statistical office, Statistics Netherlands, has been using scanner data from supermarkets to compile consumer price indices since the early 2000s, reducing respondent burden while improving the accuracy and timeliness of price statistics (Chessa, 2016).

The American Economic Association Committee on Statistics (AEAStat) has also recognised the potential of high-frequency private sector data for modernising official statistics, calling for closer collaboration between statistical agencies and private data holders (Jarmin, 2019).

But private sector data comes with significant complications. Companies have legitimate concerns about commercial confidentiality. Sharing data with government agencies may expose proprietary business information. There are also questions about data quality, representativeness (not everyone uses digital services equally), and the stability of private data sources — companies can change their systems, change their data definitions, or simply go out of business.

Privacy is another major concern. Individual-level data from telecom or financial companies is highly sensitive. Any use of such data for statistical purposes must be governed by strict legal frameworks and technical safeguards. The "Five Safes" framework developed by Desai, Ritchie, and Welpton (2016) — safe projects, safe people, safe settings, safe data, safe outputs — provides a useful model for managing these risks. Several countries, including the United Kingdom and Australia, have adopted variations of this framework for managing access to sensitive data.

The key point is that private sector data is not a replacement for surveys or administrative records. It is a complement. Its value lies in its timeliness and granularity, but these advantages must be weighed against issues of access, quality, representativeness, and privacy.


## Academic and Nonprofit Institutions

Universities, research organisations, think tanks, and international NGOs produce a substantial amount of data in Pakistan that can supplement official statistics. This data is often overlooked in discussions about national statistical systems, but it should not be.

Organisations like the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE), the Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS), the Institute of Development and Economic Alternatives (IDEAS), and the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) conduct surveys, compile datasets, and produce research that covers topics from poverty dynamics to urban development to labour market informality. International organisations like the World Bank, UNICEF, WHO, and FAO also fund and conduct data collection exercises in Pakistan — the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS), Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), and various agricultural assessments being prominent examples.

These datasets sometimes fill gaps that official statistics do not cover. They may use innovative methodologies, cover hard-to-reach populations, or address emerging issues before statistical agencies catch up. Academic researchers also bring methodological expertise in areas like small area estimation, machine learning applications for statistics, satellite imagery analysis, and privacy-preserving techniques that may not yet be fully established within PBS.

Jean et al. (2016) published a widely cited study in *Science* demonstrating how satellite imagery combined with machine learning could predict poverty levels in African countries at fine spatial resolution. This kind of methodological innovation often originates in academic settings and can eventually be adopted by statistical agencies.

However, academic and NGO data has its own limitations. Sample sizes may be small. Methodologies may not be directly comparable with official standards. Data may not be collected regularly enough to provide trend information. And there are sometimes questions about data access and documentation — not all research datasets are publicly available or well-documented.

Strengthening the link between academic institutions and the national statistical system is important. This can take many forms: formal data-sharing agreements, joint research projects, secondments of researchers to statistical agencies, advisory committees, and collaborative capacity building. The goal is to create a relationship where academic innovation feeds into official statistical practice, and where official data is accessible to researchers who can add value.


## Other Data Sources Worth Noting

Beyond the main categories above, there are several other data sources that deserve mention in Pakistan's context.

**Satellite and geospatial data** is increasingly important for statistics. Remote sensing can provide information on agricultural output, urbanisation, deforestation, flood damage, and nighttime economic activity. Pakistan already uses some satellite data for crop estimation, but the potential is much greater. The UN Global Pulse initiative has published several reports on how satellite and geospatial data can complement traditional statistics, particularly in developing countries (UN Global Pulse, 2012).

**Social media and web data** — from platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Google Trends — have been explored as potential data sources for nowcasting economic indicators, tracking disease outbreaks, and measuring public sentiment. However, these sources are highly unrepresentative in the Pakistan context, where internet penetration and social media use vary dramatically by age, income, gender, and geography. They should be used with great caution and primarily as supplementary indicators, not as primary data sources.

**Citizen-generated data** — from mobile apps, crowdsourcing platforms, and community monitoring systems — is another emerging source. This data can be timely and locally relevant but typically lacks the quality controls and representativeness needed for official statistics.

Each of these sources has the same basic profile: potentially valuable, but with significant limitations that must be carefully managed.


## The Limitations of Non-Statistical Data

It is important to be honest about the challenges. Other than statistical agencies which collect data specifically for statistical purposes, all other datasets have their own limitations when used for producing national statistics.

Administrative data was designed to serve operational needs, not statistical ones. Coverage may not be universal — FBR data, for example, only covers the formally registered tax base. Definitions and classifications may differ from those used in surveys. Data quality controls may be uneven, and errors that do not matter for administrative purposes may be significant for statistics. As Daas et al. (2015) documented in their work on using administrative data for official statistics in the Netherlands, "the fitness for statistical use of administrative data cannot be assumed but must be systematically assessed."

Private sector data raises questions of representativeness, stability, access, and privacy. Not everyone uses banks or mobile phones equally. Companies can change their data systems at any time. And sharing commercially sensitive or personally identifiable data with government agencies requires robust legal and technical safeguards.

Academic and NGO data may not be collected on a regular basis, may use non-standard methodologies, and may not cover the whole country.

Provincial data is often fragmented, with different provinces using different systems and standards.

Acknowledging these limitations is not a reason to avoid using non-statistical data. It is a reason to invest in the capabilities, legal frameworks, and quality assurance processes that make such use possible and trustworthy. The UNECE's suggested framework for the quality of big data provides a structured approach for assessing and managing these issues (UNECE, 2014).


## The Incentive Problem

Perhaps the most fundamental challenge is not technical but institutional. Most data holders currently have no incentive to share their data for the common good. This applies to federal agencies, provincial governments, and private companies alike.

Government agencies worry about losing control over their data, about being exposed to criticism if the data reveals poor performance, and about the administrative burden of preparing data for external use. Privacy and legal concerns are also genuine — many agencies are unsure whether they are legally allowed to share their data.

Private companies worry about commercial confidentiality, competitive disadvantage, and regulatory risk. They also question what they get in return for sharing their data.

This incentive problem must be addressed head-on. A successful data infrastructure cannot rely on goodwill alone. It must create conditions where sharing is beneficial, safe, and legally clear for all parties. The World Bank's Data for Better Lives report (2021) emphasised this point, arguing that "the social contract around data" must ensure that data holders see tangible benefits from participation.

Data sharing is incentivised when all data holders enjoy tangible benefits valuable to their missions. For government agencies, this might mean getting access to better statistics for their own planning and evaluation. For private companies, it might mean access to aggregated benchmarking data or recognition as responsible corporate citizens. For all parties, the legal framework must provide clear protections and obligations, so that data sharing is not a discretionary favour but a structured, predictable process.

The societal benefits of better national statistics — improved policy, better targeting of resources, more effective governance, enhanced accountability — are ultimately proportionate to the costs and risks of data sharing. But these benefits need to be communicated clearly and consistently. People and organisations share data when they trust the system and understand why it matters.
