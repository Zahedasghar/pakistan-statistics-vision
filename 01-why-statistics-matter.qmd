# Why Statistics Matter and Where Pakistan Stands Today

Every modern government makes decisions on the basis of statistical information, whether it recognises this dependency or not. When a finance minister allocates development funds across provinces, the allocation formula relies on population counts and economic indicators. When a health ministry decides where to build new facilities, it draws on data about disease burden, facility utilisation, and geographic coverage. When a planning commission sets growth targets, it uses national accounts estimates and labour force statistics. When a political opposition challenges the government's claims of progress, the challenge is credible only if there are independent numbers to point to. 

> Statistics, in this sense, are not a technical luxury. They are the informational foundation on which governance, accountability, and democratic debate all rest.  


When the numbers are absent, outdated, or untrustworthy, the consequences are not abstract. Resources are allocated on the basis of political bargaining rather than evidence. Policies are designed on the basis of assumptions rather than facts. Programme failures go undetected because there are no baseline measurements against which to assess performance. Citizens who suspect the government is misrepresenting conditions have no authentic source to consult. The absence of credible statistics creates a space that is filled by rumour, manipulation, and guesswork. As a result, people who suffer most from this are those who are already least visible to the state.

There are parallels between data infrastructure and physical infrastructure and its not merely a convenient analogy. A road is useful not in itself but because people and goods move on it. A statistical system is useful not because it collects data but because the data is used — by governments designing policies, by businesses planning investments, by researchers studying social and economic dynamics, by journalists holding power to account, and by ordinary citizens trying to understand the conditions of their own lives. The value of data infrastructure, like the value of transport infrastructure, is realised through use. When data sits unused in the filing systems of government agencies, its potential is wasted as surely as a highway built to nowhere.

    The United States National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine made this comparison the organising framework of its landmark 2023 report, *Toward a 21st Century National Data Infrastructure*. The report argued that "just as bridges and highways facilitate the transportation necessary for commerce, statistical information informs decisions by governments, business enterprises, and individuals" (NASEM, 2023). The report went further: it described a paradox now confronting statistical systems worldwide. The traditional method of producing national statistics — large-scale probability surveys conducted by government statistical agencies — is under severe pressure from declining participation rates, rising costs, and growing demand for more timely and more granular information. Yet at the same time, the volume of digital data being generated about the activities of individuals and businesses has never been greater. The challenge is to build infrastructure that can mobilise these new data assets while maintaining the rigour and public trust that legitimate statistics require.

This challenge is universal. But its stakes are particularly high in countries like Pakistan, where the gap between what the statistical system produces and what governance requires is already large and growing wider. In a country where political discourse frequently revolves around competing claims — about the size of the economy, the number of people living in poverty, the quality of public services, the distribution of resources across provinces — the absence of authoritative, timely, and trusted statistics is not merely an inconvenience. It is a structural weakness in the democratic process itself. When citizens and their elected representatives cannot agree on the facts, debate becomes a contest of assertions rather than an exchange of evidence. An efficient and accountable government depend fundamentally on the availability of data that all parties accept as credible.

## What Pakistan Needs to Know About Itself

Pakistan is a country of 241 million people, the fifth most populous nation on earth, with a young and rapidly growing population that is urbanising at one of the fastest rates in South Asia. The challenges facing the country are enormous and interconnected: a stunting rate that affects roughly 40 percent of children under five; a net primary enrolment rate that still leaves almost 22 million children out of school; a labour market in which the majority of employment is informal and therefore largely invisible to official statistics; an economy in which tax collection as a share of GDP remains among the lowest in the region; energy systems under strain; agricultural production increasingly vulnerable to climate shocks; and persistent inequalities across provinces, between urban and rural areas, and between men and women.

None of these challenges can be addressed effectively without credible data. To design a social protection programme that reaches the poorest households, you need to know who is poor, where they live, and what characterises their deprivation. To improve primary education, you need to know not just how many children are enrolled but whether they are learning and what happens to them after they leave school. To reform the tax system, you need to understand who is paying, who is not, and why. To respond to a flood or a drought, you need real-time information about which areas are affected, how many people are displaced, and what resources they need. To hold provincial governments accountable for their use of development funds after the 18th Amendment devolved responsibilities to the provinces, you need provincial- and district-level data that is comparable, timely, and independently verifiable.

Pakistan needs, in other words, a statistical system capable of answering the questions that matter most for its future. The question is whether the system it currently has is up to this task.

## A System Built for a Different Era

Pakistan's current statistical infrastructure, like other countries in the world, was designed for the conditions of the 20^{th} century. It has served the country with reasonable adequacy under those conditions. The Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) — the national statistical agency operating under the Statistics Division within the Ministry of Planning, Development and Special Initiatives — has historically relied on two principal instruments: periodic censuses and sample surveys. The population census, constitutionally mandated every ten years, provides the demographic baseline. The Pakistan Social and Living Standards Measurement Survey (PSLM), the Household Integrated Economic Survey (HIES), the Labour Force Survey (LFS), and other periodic exercises provide the social and economic indicators on which policy has been built.

This model has genuine strengths. Probability sampling, when properly implemented, allows a relatively small number of surveyed households to generate statistically valid estimates for large populations. The surveys conducted by PBS have produced the core indicators — literacy rates, enrolment ratios, poverty estimates, unemployment rates, health access measures — that have shaped Pakistan's development discourse for decades. The 2023 Digital Census, which deployed 121,000 enumerators equipped with tablets linked to geographic information systems, represented a significant technological advance and geo-tagged approximately 40 million structures across the country. The HIES 2024-25, released in early 2026, was the first fully digital household economic survey in PBS history.

But the model is under pressure from multiple directions simultaneously, and the pressures are intensifying.

## The Pressures Are Real

First, the economics of survey-based data collection are increasingly unfavourable. Surveys are expensive to design, field, and process. The PSLM district-level survey requires enumerating roughly 195,000 households across thousands of sampling units — a logistically enormous operation requiring trained field staff, transport, supervision, quality control, and data processing infrastructure. As costs rise, the frequency, sample size, or geographic coverage of surveys must be sacrificed. Pakistan cannot simultaneously afford annual surveys at the district level, quarterly labour force surveys at the provincial level, and the specialised surveys (on time use, disability, migration, agriculture) that specific policy questions demand. Something has to give, and what gives is either timeliness, granularity, or both.

Second, survey response rates globally are declining, and Pakistan is not immune. Respondent burden — the time and effort required to complete lengthy questionnaires — is a growing concern, particularly in urban areas where households are more mobile and less willing to participate. The HIES 2024-25 reported a non-response rate of 1.86 percent, which appears low but understates the challenge: 157 primary sampling units out of 2,500 were dropped entirely due to "administrative and other issues." In many countries, the decline in survey participation has been dramatic enough to threaten the validity of the estimates produced. The NASEM report described this as a "severe threat to the quality of statistical information" (NASEM, 2023). The problem is self-reinforcing: as participation declines, the remaining respondents become less representative of the population, which erodes the quality of estimates, which erodes public trust in the numbers, which makes future participation even harder to obtain.

Third, and perhaps most important, the demand for statistical information has changed qualitatively. Policymakers no longer want national-level estimates published twelve to eighteen months after data collection. They want provincial and district-level data. They want it quarterly or monthly, not annually. They want to be able to track the effects of specific interventions — a cash transfer programme, a school construction initiative, a health campaign — in near real-time. They want to understand the intersections between different dimensions of wellbeing: how health affects educational outcomes, how education affects employment, how employment affects poverty. None of these demands can be met by a system that relies exclusively on periodic, standalone surveys, each designed for a single purpose and published on its own schedule.

Fourth, the current system operates in silos. PBS conducts its surveys. NADRA maintains its biometric databases. BISP manages its beneficiary registry. The Federal Board of Revenue holds tax records. Provincial health departments operate DHIS2. Provincial education departments maintain NEMIS. Each agency collects data for its own administrative purposes, using its own definitions, coding systems, and formats. There is no systematic mechanism for combining these data sources to produce richer statistical products. When a researcher or policymaker needs to understand the relationship between, say, household income, health utilisation, and educational attainment, they find that the data exists in multiple agencies but cannot be linked, because no common identifiers, shared standards, or institutional arrangements for data sharing are in place.

The poet Coleridge's observation — "water, water, everywhere, nor any drop to drink" — captures the situation precisely. Pakistan is not short of data. It is short of infrastructure that makes data usable.

## The Census as a Case Study

The population census illustrates both the strengths and the limitations of the current system. The Constitution mandates a census every ten years, but Pakistan has managed only seven since independence — in 1951, 1961, 1972, 1981, 1998, 2017, and 2023. The gap between 1998 and 2017 — nineteen years — meant that for nearly two decades, the country's most basic demographic information was outdated, with profound consequences for political representation, resource allocation, and development planning.

The 2023 Digital Census was a significant achievement, deploying advanced technology at enormous scale. But the census also illustrated systemic challenges. Enumeration, originally planned for one month, was extended five times as coverage in major cities — Karachi, Lahore, Faisalabad — proved difficult. The results, like those of 2017 before them, became politically contested, with the Government of Sindh and several political parties challenging the count for Karachi. These controversies are not unique to Pakistan — census results are politically sensitive everywhere because they determine political representation and resource allocation. But they are exacerbated by the long intervals between censuses. When a country goes nineteen years without a census, as Pakistan did between 1998 and 2017, the stakes attached to each individual count become so high that the exercise itself become a source of political conflict rather than a resolution of it.

The census also consumed enormous institutional energy and resources that, in a more diversified statistical system, might have been complemented by continuously updated population estimates derived from administrative records — birth registrations, NADRA identity records, school enrolments — rather than depending entirely on a single decennial exercise. The Nordic countries, for example, have largely replaced traditional field-based censuses with register-based censuses that use linked administrative data to produce population statistics at a fraction of the cost and with far greater frequency. Pakistan is not in a position to replicate this approach immediately, but the direction of travel is clear: the future of population statistics lies in the continuous integration of multiple data sources, not in periodic mobilisations of six-figure enumerator armies.

This is the fundamental limitation: the current system places too much weight on large, periodic, standalone data collection exercises and too little on the continuous, systematic use of the data that government agencies already collect in the course of their daily operations. The data is there. What is missing is the infrastructure — technical, institutional, and legal — to connect it.

## The Case for Transformation

The argument of this document, developed across the chapters that follow, is that Pakistan needs a fundamental shift in how it produces and uses statistical information. This shift involves not abandoning surveys — which remain essential for measuring dimensions of life that administrative records cannot capture — but supplementing them with a data infrastructure that can blend survey data with administrative records, geospatial data, and other sources to produce statistics that are more timely, more granular, and more useful than any single source can provide alone.

This requires action on multiple fronts. It requires repositioning PBS from a data collector into a national data coordinator and steward. It requires establishing common standards for data quality, documentation, and interoperability. It requires building the institutional and legal frameworks for governed data sharing across agencies. It requires investing in human capacity — in data science, record linkage, statistical disclosure control, and data governance. It requires taking seriously the ethical obligations owed to the people whose data is being used, including robust privacy protections and meaningful accountability for misuse. And it requires designing the infrastructure not just for today's analytical methods but for the AI-driven methods that will increasingly define the frontier of what is possible.

None of this will happen overnight, and none of it will happen without sustained political commitment, institutional reform, and investment. But the costs of inaction — a country of 241 million people governing itself on the basis of incomplete, outdated, and fragmented information — are far greater than the costs of building the infrastructure that a modern statistical system requires.

The chapters that follow develop each element of this argument in detail. They examine how other countries have built modern data infrastructure and what Pakistan can learn from their experience. They set out the case for blended data — the systematic combination of survey, administrative, and other data sources — and the technical, institutional, and governance conditions it requires. They discuss the organisational models available for managing a national data infrastructure, the quality standards that must govern it, and the ethical frameworks that must protect the people whose data it uses. They address the emerging demands of artificial intelligence and the data foundations it requires. And they propose a sequenced set of short- and medium-term priorities for moving from the current system to the one the country needs.

Throughout, the argument rests on a simple premise: that the data Pakistan needs to govern itself effectively largely already exists, scattered across government agencies and systems that do not communicate with each other. The task is not primarily to collect more data. It is to build the infrastructure — technical, institutional, legal, and human — that connects what exists into a coherent, trustworthy, and usable picture of the country and its people.
