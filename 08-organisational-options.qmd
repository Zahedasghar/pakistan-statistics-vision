# Organisational Options for the New Infrastructure

There is no single correct organisational model for a national data infrastructure. This is a statement that appears in nearly every major report on the subject, and it is worth taking seriously. The design of the institution — who coordinates data access, who sets standards, who makes decisions about linkage and sharing, who is held accountable — matters enormously. It determines whether the infrastructure actually functions or remains an aspiration documented in strategy papers. Different countries have arrived at different arrangements, shaped by their legal traditions, political structures, and the capacities of their existing institutions. Pakistan will need to find the model that fits its own context. But it will benefit from understanding what has been tried elsewhere, what has worked, and why.

The temptation in discussions of organisational design is to treat it as a technical question — draw an organogram, assign responsibilities, and move on. But in the context of data infrastructure, organisational form is deeply political. It involves questions about who gets access to whose data, under what conditions, with what safeguards, and subject to whose oversight. These are questions of power, trust, and institutional legitimacy. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM), in its landmark 2023 report on building a 21st-century national data infrastructure for the United States, emphasised that such infrastructure requires not only technical capabilities but also a legal and regulatory framework that clearly defines which data assets can be shared, with whom, and for what purposes (NASEM, 2023). In countries with decentralised statistical systems — and Pakistan's system is among the most fragmented — these questions are especially difficult. The 18th Amendment devolved many statistical functions to the provinces, while the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) retains a federal coordination mandate that, in practice, lacks the authority and resources to be fully effective. Any organisational model for a new data infrastructure must be designed with this constitutional reality firmly in mind.

## Lessons from Centralised and Distributed Architectures

Before examining Pakistan's specific options, it is instructive to observe the range of approaches that countries have taken, because these reveal something important: institutional design follows from context, not from theory.

At one end of the spectrum sits the fully centralised model. Statistics Netherlands (CBS) developed the System of Social Statistical Datasets (SSD), a centralised data library in which administrative registers from across government are linked at the individual level using unique personal identification numbers. This infrastructure enabled the Netherlands to conduct its 2001 census entirely from registers and surveys, without traditional field enumeration — the so-called "virtual census" (Bakker, van Rooijen and van Toor, 2014). The Dutch model works because CBS has clear legal authority to access administrative data, a mature population register infrastructure, and decades of experience in record linkage. It also works because the Netherlands is small, highly digitalised, and characterised by strong institutional trust. None of these conditions obtain in Pakistan, which makes the fully centralised model instructive as an aspiration but impractical as a starting point.

At the opposite end sits the distributed model, and Estonia's X-Road is the most cited example. Launched in 2001, X-Road is a decentralised data exchange layer connecting over 900 public and private sector institutions, enabling secure real-time data queries across government databases without centralising data storage. Each agency maintains its own systems and controls access to its own data. The architecture was deliberately designed to avoid creating a single database that could become a vulnerability — a decision shaped by a major data leak in 1996 when a government contractor compiled and sold a "superdatabase" of personal records from multiple government sources (Vassil, 2016). What makes X-Road work is not just technology but a combination of universal digital identity, legal mandates for the "once-only" collection of citizen data, and sustained political commitment over two decades. For Pakistan, the distributed principle is attractive — agencies that are reluctant to surrender data might be more willing to share it through a controlled platform — but the enabling conditions (universal digital ID, legal interoperability mandates, high digital literacy) are only partially present. NADRA's CNIC system provides a foundation, but much else remains to be built.

The honest conclusion from international experience is that most functioning data infrastructures are hybrids. They combine a lead coordinating agency with distributed data holdings, shared governance mechanisms, and specialised entities for particular functions. The question for Pakistan is what form the hybrid should take, given the country's particular institutional constraints.

## Why Legal Authority Must Come First

The United Kingdom's experience is particularly instructive here, not because the UK model can be transplanted wholesale but because it illustrates a sequencing principle that Pakistan should take seriously: legal authority must precede institutional design.

The UK's Digital Economy Act 2017 created specific legal gateways for public authorities to share de-identified information with accredited researchers for public-good research. The Act also established the accreditation framework — administered by the UK Statistics Authority — for researchers, projects, and processing environments, structured around what is known as the Five Safes framework: safe projects, safe people, safe settings, safe data, and safe outputs (Ritchie, 2017). Only after this legal foundation was in place did the UK build its major data infrastructure investment, Administrative Data Research UK (ADR UK), established in 2018 with £44 million from the Economic and Social Research Council. ADR UK operates as a partnership between the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and three national partnerships in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. ONS serves as the main data infrastructure partner, operating the Secure Research Service where linked administrative datasets are made available to accredited researchers. Crucially, ADR UK chose to build on an existing trusted institution rather than creating an entirely new one. As the programme's leadership noted, "government and the public already trust ONS to handle administrative data safely and securely" (ADR UK, 2020).

Two lessons emerge. First, without legislation that creates clear data-sharing gateways with appropriate safeguards, any organisational model will operate in a legal grey zone that breeds caution and non-cooperation among data holders. Pakistan's General Statistics (Reorganization) Act 2011 empowers PBS to access records and documents maintained by government departments, but this is not the same as a comprehensive data-sharing framework with defined conditions, safeguards, and accountability mechanisms for the routine flow of administrative data into the statistical system. Equivalent legislation — something that creates the Pakistani version of the Five Safes — is a prerequisite for whatever organisational form is ultimately chosen. Second, building on institutions that already possess public trust is more effective than starting from scratch. This has implications for whether PBS should be the anchor institution, and under what conditions.

## The Question of PBS

The most natural starting point is to strengthen PBS itself as the central coordinating institution. This builds on existing legal authority, an established institutional identity, and relationships with international organisations. And it avoids the political complexity of creating new statutory bodies.

But the gap between PBS's formal mandate and its actual capacity is wide. The World Bank's 2025 assessment of Pakistan's statistical system noted that PBS needs significant infrastructure and capacity upgrades, that provincial bureaus of statistics remain weak with limited technical and institutional capacity following their devolution in 2011, and that coordination between federal and provincial nodes lacks frameworks for data sharing and quality assurance (World Bank, 2025). PBS operates with roughly 73 percent of its sanctioned posts filled, with acute shortages at senior technical grades — only 6 out of 17 BS-20 positions were occupied at the time of assessment. The 2019 decision to abolish the Statistics Division and place PBS under the Ministry of Planning, Development and Special Initiatives further complicated matters. Recent commentators have argued that this move, by placing the producers of statistics under a line ministry, violated the spirit of sound statistical governance and made PBS vulnerable to political pressure on everything from GDP figures to livestock counts (Javed, 2025). The call to restore the 2011 Act and strengthen the chief statistician's authority to resist interference and coordinate all official statistics-producing agencies is not merely an academic argument — it is a precondition for PBS to credibly serve as the institutional anchor for a multi-source data infrastructure.

India's experience is relevant here, given the similarities in scale, complexity, and federal structure. India's Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) operates the National Statistical Office (NSO), which combines the Central Statistical Office with the National Sample Survey Office. An independent National Statistical Commission, established in 2006 on the recommendation of the Rangarajan Commission, provides oversight. Below the federal level, each of India's 28 states and 8 union territories maintain its own Directorate of Economics and Statistics. A 2025 conference of state ministers on strengthening statistical systems highlighted both the aspiration for better coordination and the continuing challenge: most states requested technical assistance and training from MoSPI, while calling for greater financial support through the Support for Statistical Strengthening Scheme (MoSPI, 2025). What India demonstrates is that in large federal systems, coordination depends not only on institutional design at the centre but on sustained investment in subnational capacity — and that even with strong central institutions, achieving coherence across states require continuous political and bureaucratic engagement. For Pakistan, the implication is that strengthening PBS alone is insufficient; there must be parallel investment in provincial bureaus, with incentives for voluntary participation in a coordinated system.

For PBS to serve as the institutional home for a multi-source data infrastructure, it would need at minimum: restoration and strengthening of its legal autonomy; a dedicated data integration unit with authority to negotiate data-sharing agreements across federal and provincial government; investment in secure computing infrastructure for handling linked administrative datasets; recruitment and retention of staff with skills in data science, record linkage, and modern statistical methodology; and a principles-based governance framework that provides data-holding agencies with confidence that their data will be handled appropriately.

## Creating Separate Specialist Functions

An alternative — or more accurately a complement — is to establish separate entities for specific functions that PBS is not well-positioned to perform in its current state.

The concept of a dedicated data integration service has gained currency internationally. The US Commission on Evidence-Based Policymaking recommended establishing a National Secure Data Service (NSDS) to facilitate the secure blending of government administrative records, survey data, and private sector data for statistical and evidence-building purposes. This concept was legislated as a demonstration project in the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 (NASEM, 2023). The NSDS would not replace existing statistical agencies but complement them by providing the technical infrastructure and governance mechanisms for cross-agency data linkage. A Pakistani equivalent — perhaps a statutory National Data Integration Service — could be established with its own governing board, mandate, and budget, responsible for negotiating data access, conducting record linkage, maintaining secure environments for research, and enforcing quality standards, while PBS continues its core functions in surveys, censuses, and national accounts.

Australia's institutional separation offers a real-world demonstration that this approach can work. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW), established by its own Act of Parliament in 1987, operates as an independent statutory body with its own ethics committee and accreditation as a Commonwealth Integrating Authority. AIHW brings together data from across the health and welfare systems using a distributed linkage model in which state and territory data linkage units connect to a common spine (AIHW, 2022). This is functionally separate from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, which handles surveys and censuses. Governance is provided through Australia's Data Availability and Transparency Act 2022, which adopted its own version of the Five Safes as "Five Data Sharing Principles" (Australian Productivity Commission, 2017). The lesson is that data integration can be separated from the primary statistical agency without losing coherence, provided governance frameworks are clear, consistently applied, and backed by legislation.

A less ambitious but potentially more feasible variant for Pakistan is a trusted research environment — a secure facility, physical or virtual, where accredited researchers access linked datasets under controlled conditions. In the United States, 31 Federal Statistical Research Data Centers (FSRDCs) located at universities and Federal Reserve banks facilitate collaborative agreements between academic institutions and statistical agencies. Creating even one such facility in Pakistan — at a university with strong quantitative research capacity, operating under PBS oversight and with data shared under negotiated agreements — could serve as a pilot for the broader infrastructure while simultaneously building trust among data-holding agencies and demonstrating the value of integrated data to policymakers. This is a low-risk entry point that does not require new legislation or a new statutory body, only willingness from PBS and at least one data-holding agency to cooperate on specific, bounded projects.

ADR UK itself is, at its core, a research-government partnership funded by a research council and operating through universities and statistical agencies. In Pakistan, a similar arrangement could bring universities into the infrastructure — not merely as users of data but as institutional partners responsible for analytical capacity, methodological development, and the training of data professionals. Universities can conduct the methodological research on record linkage techniques, privacy-preserving methods, and quality assessment for administrative data that underpins the whole enterprise. And they can provide an environment where experimentation is possible in ways that government agencies, with their accountability structures and risk aversion, may find it difficult to allow. The limitation is sustainability. University-based partnerships in developing countries depend frequently on project funding with limited time horizons. When the project ends, the partnership dissolve and capacity dissipate. If this model is pursued, it must be designed from the outset with a sustainability plan — ideally involving a legislative mandate, core government funding, and institutional structures that outlast any particular funding cycle.

## Governing Sensitive Domains Through Stewardship Arrangements

For some categories of data, conventional organisational models may need to be supplemented with governance mechanisms that provide stronger protections and broader stakeholder representation.

The Open Data Institute (ODI) in the United Kingdom has explored a range of "data institutions" — organisations whose primary purpose is the stewardship of data on behalf of others. These include data trusts providing independent fiduciary stewardship, data cooperatives governed by their members, and data commons maintained collaboratively for shared use (Hardinges, 2020; Dodds et al., 2020). In a strict legal sense, a data trust involves trustees who hold a fiduciary duty — a legal obligation of impartiality and loyalty — to the beneficiaries of the data. This is a powerful governance mechanism because it subordinates the interests of any particular agency or user to those of data subjects and the public. However, the concept remain largely experimental globally, and the ODI itself has acknowledged that data trusts represent just one approach among many.

For Pakistan, the data trust concept is most relevant not as the primary organisational model for the entire infrastructure but as a governance mechanism for specific sensitive domains. A health data governance board — with representation from health ministries at federal and provincial levels, patient advocacy groups, medical researchers, and independent ethics experts — could govern the terms under which DHIS2 health facility data is linked with vital registration and other administrative records. Similarly, a social protection data governance arrangement could oversee the integration of BISP beneficiary data with education, health, and employment records, ensuring that the linking of such data serves the interests of the vulnerable populations whose information it contains, rather than becoming a tool for surveillance or exclusion. This domain-specific governance approach complements whatever primary organisational model is chosen for the infrastructure as a whole.

## What Is Actually Feasible

Any discussion of organisational options must reckon honestly with Pakistan's institutional constraints. The 18th Amendment has fundamentally altered the distribution of authority, and any organisational model must respect the constitutional reality that many statistical and administrative functions are now provincial responsibilities. A purely federal entity that attempts to compel provincial compliance will face resistance. The infrastructure must be designed as a cooperative arrangement in which provinces participate voluntarily, motivated by the tangible benefits they receive — access to integrated data products, technical assistance, training, and financial support. India's Support for Statistical Strengthening Scheme offers one template: federal investment in provincial capacity, conditional on adoption of common standards and participation in coordination mechanisms.

PBS's current institutional position presents a further complication. Placed under the Ministry of Planning in 2019, it lacks the independent authority envisioned by the 2011 Act. The chief statistician does not currently have the standing to negotiate with powerful agencies like NADRA, FBR, or the State Bank as an equal. Restoring PBS's statutory autonomy is not an abstract governance ideal — it is a practical requirement for the data-sharing negotiations that must underpin any infrastructure.

Given these constraints, the most realistic approach is probably a phased strategy rather than a single organisational choice made at the outset.

In the near term, the priority should be legal and institutional reform: restoring PBS's statutory autonomy, enacting data-sharing legislation with safeguards analogous to the Five Safes, and establishing a national statistics advisory body with representation from both federal and provincial governments. Simultaneously, PBS should establish or expand a data integration unit — even a small one — with the mandate to develop agreements, conduct pilot linkage projects with willing agencies, and build secure data handling capacity. NADRA's CNIC database and FBR's tax records are obvious starting points for pilot work.

In the medium term, a trusted research environment established jointly by PBS and one or more universities could provide accredited researchers with access to linked datasets under controlled conditions, generating analytical products that demonstrate value to policymakers while building broader institutional confidence in the infrastructure.

In the longer term, the model may evolve toward a more elaborate partnership — with PBS as the central infrastructure partner, provincial bureaus as regional nodes, university-based centres providing analytical capacity, and domain-specific governance arrangements for sensitive data in health, social protection, and other area where public sensitivity is highest. A distributed technical architecture — in which agencies maintain their own data but connect through a shared platform with common standards — may be more appropriate for Pakistan's federal structure than full centralisation.

The important point is that organisational design is not a one-time decision made on paper and then implemented. It is an evolving process that responds to developing legal frameworks, growing capacities, and accumulating trust among participants. What matters most at the outset is not choosing the theoretically perfect model but getting the fundamentals right: legal authority, institutional autonomy, governance principles, and the willingness to begin with modest pilot projects and learn from what they teach. The infrastructure will be built incrementally, and the organisational form will mature alongside the capacities of the institutions that operate it. What Pakistan cannot afford is to wait for the perfect design before taking the first practical steps.
